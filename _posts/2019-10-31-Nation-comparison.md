date: 2019-10-31

This blog is about one of my project to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Comparing Nations and determine if they are Converging or Diverging.
Hans Rosling gave a famous TED talk in 2007, “The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen”. Rosling was a Professor of International Health at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden and founded the Gapminder Foundation alongwith his Son , Ola.They included a number of datasets on the Gapminder website which we have used in our analysis.
We designed our analysis to compare decade-over-decade using Gap minder data set to compare nations across a variety of different categories(such as education,health,GDP,Gini index,technology,Energy,Population etc)

Methodology:
1.Gathered data from the internet using gap-minder hyperlinks 
2.Data frames were created using Python code
3.24 separate files were created (8X3)
4.8 categories :  Health, Society, Population, Infrastructure, Economy, Education, Energy, & Work 
5.3 decades for each category :  1990’s ,  2000’s,  2010’s 
6.Over 520 indicators were looked at across all categories
7.Principle component Analysis (PCA) was done for dimensionality reduction 
8.Clustering was performed to group similar countries by Normal Mixtures method
9.Interactive Tableau Dashboard was created to show change and comparison across the globe
